### Abstract ###
The trends in high performance computing, where far more data can be computed that can ever be stored, have made in situ techniques an important area of research and development. Simulation campaigns, where domain scientists work with computer scientists to run a simulation and perform in situ analysis and visualization are important, and complex undertakings.

In this paper we report our experiences performing in situ analysis and visualization on two campaigns. The two campaigns were related, but had important differences in terms of the codes that were used, the types of analysis and visualization required, and the visualization tools used. Further, we report the lessons learned from each campaign.
