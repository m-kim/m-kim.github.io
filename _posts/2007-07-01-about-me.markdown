Mark is a computer scientist in the [Scientific Data Group](https://www.ornl.gov/division/csmd/scientific-data), in the [Computer Science and Mathematics Division](https://www.ornl.gov/division/csmd/) of [Oak Ridge National Laboratory](https://www.ornl.gov). His work at Oak Ridge is focused on in situ analysis and visualization. In the high performance computing world, there is an increasingly large disconnect between multiple levels of a supercomputer (compute vs memory vs disk vs network storage). This has a knock-on effect for scientific visualization: previously, computational simulations were stored to a network file system and visualization of the data was performed on a separate visualization cluster in a post hoc manner. The bandwidth problem has forced a rethink of how scientific visualization is performed, where the visualization needs to be coupled to the simulation. With the advent of heterogenous supercomputers, such as [OLCF](https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/) [Summit](https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/olcf-resources/compute-systems/summit/) which uses GPU accelerators, scientific visualization codes need to adapt to this ever changing landscape. One way to address this issue is with toolkits that are write-once/run-anywhere: in other words, [VTK-m](https://m.vtk.org).

Previously, Mark was a postdoctoral researcher at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Prior to that, he was a postdoctoral researcher in the [Scientific Computing and Imaging (SCI) Institute](http://www.sci.utah.edu) at the [University of Utah](http://www.utah.edu). Mark earned his PhD from the University of Utah, advised by [Chuck Hansen](http://www.cs.utah.edu/~hansen) with a focus on scientific visualization of surfaces, particularly surface flow visualization.`
