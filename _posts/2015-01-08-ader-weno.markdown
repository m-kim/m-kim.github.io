Garch et al. (EuroVis 2012) cites Dumbser et al. (JCP 2007) for its finite volume WENO advection. Having looked into it (briefly) I think it builds a 1D WENO stencil as a pre-process to determine the volume in cell, then flux through the face.

Github has this:

for ADER-WENO.

For advection-diffusion in general, I think this is a nice explanation.

Edit:<br/>
Finally figured out what "ADER" means: Arbitrary DERivative in space and time from

The author in the previous PDF had a related paper at arvxiv.
