Slowly moving forward.
setDtStep(0.2)
grid=768
subgrid=(3,3,3)
grid_offset = 3
normalize=true
proj_onto_surf=false
uflic_minute = 1
uflic_ht = 1

Some stuff sneaks to the other side of the bulb.

Let's try grid=512

Follows the twist, but halts in the same spot.

Move starting spot to orig_pts[0]->size()/5
Still halts.

Move starting spot to orig_pts[0]->size()/4
Still halts.

Move starting spot to orig_pts[0]->size()/3.5
Still halts.

Change setDtStep to 0.1
Pushes forward, but still stops.

Change dye_advection:computeDye so it uses the cur point (instead of the cell_pt)
as the starting point as the backwards advection.
Nothing changes.

Change dye_advection:computeDye so its cell_pt + 0.5
Whoa, breaking everything.


FINALLY! It seems that there are patches missing *right where things go wonky.*
Even setting grid to 256 with subgrid to 6,6,6 there are patches missing.
But, setting the subgrid to (1,1,1), no patches. Interesting.

WTF.
