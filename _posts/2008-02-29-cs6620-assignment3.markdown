All images were generated on a MacBook 2.16Ghz C2D with 2GB of RAM Leopard with XCode.&nbsp; Strangely enough, I believe the times are for debugging and not for release.&nbsp; Although I switched it to release mode, it was still debugging.&nbsp; *shrug*&nbsp;

[*Required Image* (0.788 sec)]({{"/assets/prog03.ppm" | prepend: site.baseurl}})

[*Creative Image 1* (2.82 sec)]({{"/assets/creative.ppm" | prepend: site.baseurl}})

For my creative image I first created a saddle using the height field generator.

f = (x^2 - y^2) *a

where a is some value greater than 0.&nbsp; In this particular case I think I chose 3.

I think positioned two saddles between a metal material ball and a glass material ball (note though its not beer's) and generated the image. 

The code can be found <!--[[download:Assignment3.zip:text:here.:]]&nbsp;-->

*Resources*

Class notes because neither PBRT nor Ray Tracing from the Ground Up had information about height fields.

*Time*

Hard to say mostly because I made two very careless errors that cost me almost a day.&nbsp; I also had a hard time figuring out what the notes really said, but that's because I can't seem to read properly anymore.
