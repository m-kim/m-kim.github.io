Yesterday, I came to the conclusion that it was the oniony aspect of the dataset 
that was creating the artifacts. To test this, I removed the triangles from the center
of the "bulb" and advected on it.  Here's what we get.

<iframe width="640" height="480" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/20150303/test.mp4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<iframe width="640" height="480" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/20150303/test2.mp4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


To see more of the flow, I rotated the flow and snapped this image:
![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/20150303/test2-1.png)

It is smeared because there are two parts of the surface close to each other.
![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/20150303/test2-2.png )

So it looks like the surface is too close to itself and that's why 
I'm getting errors.
