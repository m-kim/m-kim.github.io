####Design Decisions####

Not too many this time around.  I did not like the marble pattern used in the required image for use on my checker's board.  So, I changed it to

1 - (sin(40*x + turbulence(,P*4, lacunarity, gain)*.5 + .5)^6 

I thought it looked nicer as a marble pattern on a marble chessboard.   I think it turned out okay.  I called it &quot;PhongRealMarbleMaterial&quot; and I don't consider it an extra credit piece.  Its just playing with the variable.  =D
