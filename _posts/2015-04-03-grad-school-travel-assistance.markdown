Presenting our work, "Surface Flow Visualization Using the Closest Point Embedding" at a premier conference such as the IEEE Pacific Visualization Conference is important for my growth as a researcher. Discussing it amongst peers and getting feedback is incredibly important for continuing my research as well as developing new insights in the field. Further, making connections with other researchers, especially international researchers, in my area is critical as my career progresses. 

Further, presenting our work at Pacific Visualization continues the mission of the Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute as a world-class leader in scientific visualization. Further, it solidifies the School of Computing as a nurturing environment for potential students around the world to do good research in graphics and visualization.
